You must pass all arguments and commands, otherwise an error will occur.

## script 2:
`./script1.sh try <args> <command>`

try arguments:

```
Interval and Number can be set with environment variables. If you don't pass arguments and don't define environment variables, script uses default variables, which are `5` for Interval time and `12` for Number.
